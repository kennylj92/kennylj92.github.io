    "description": "I am a very self motivated and quick learning individual. I believe that Prime Academy would be a great opportunity for me to further my education. I have always taken an interest in computer technology and I'm looking for a serious schooling environment that can help me breakout into this career field. I had recently taken courses at Dakota County Technical College for software development in fall of 2012. I heard about Prime Academy from my cousin who had nothing but great things to say about the program. He is currently a lead web developer himself and works with some colleagues that have taken the program and loved it. That is why I believe that Prime Academy would be a great place for me to thrive and get the proper education." ,
